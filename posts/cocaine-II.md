## Cocaine II

At first Arthur allowed himself to believe he could manage it. The second pill
restored the brilliance with such theatrical precision that it felt almost
ordained. The headache dissolved into a bright fizz at the back of his skull,
the heaviness lifted from his limbs, and the suburban estate resumed its
immaculate glow. Lawns regained their lacquered sheen, the sky settled into its
impossible blue, and the smiles of passers by seemed not merely genuine but
benevolent. Yet beneath the euphoria lay an awareness that had not been present
before. He could feel the scaffolding beneath the joy now. The laughter rose a
fraction too quickly, the eye contact lingered a second too long, and every
compliment carried the faint aftertaste of compulsion. The world was radiant,
yes, but it was also maintained, propped up by white tablets and collective
insistence.

When the effect began to ebb again it did so with greater cruelty. The comedown
struck like weather rolling in across open land. A tightening band cinched
itself around his temples and his thoughts, so recently effervescent, turned
granular and brittle. His body sagged as though the strings holding him upright
had been snipped. Colours thinned visibly before his eyes. The pastel houses
dulled, the immaculate lawns flattened into something more ordinary, and the
smiles he encountered on the pavement revealed strain at their edges, tiny
tremors in cheek and eyelid that suggested effort rather than delight. He felt
the grey seep back into his perception and, with it, the old internal murmur
that life was an elaborate joke told at his expense. Fearful of that familiar
descent, he reached for another pill with a desperation he did not pause to
examine.

The third night marked the beginning of his unravelling. Sleep would not come.
His heart beat with an urgent, mechanical persistence that refused the
softening required for rest. Lying in the pristine bedroom assigned to him,
beneath mint walls and crisply folded sheets, he felt like a man attempting to
power down a machine that had lost the ability to switch off. After hours of
staring at the ceiling he rose and pulled open the blinds, expecting darkness to
impose some sense of limit upon the town. Instead he found movement everywhere.
Joggers traced the pavements beneath street-lamps. Neighbours conversed brightly
across garden fences. Windows glowed with steady, wakeful light. It dawned on
him that this was not merely a happy community but a continuous one, a place
that did not concede to fatigue. A 24/7 society, he thought, and the phrase
echoed with quiet dread.

The hallucinations began subtly, as disturbances at the edge of vision that
could almost be dismissed as tricks of exhaustion. A shape slipping behind a
hedge. A darker patch in a doorway that seemed to shift when he blinked. At
first he attributed them to lack of sleep, to the chemical turbulence in his
bloodstream. Yet they persisted and grew bolder. Shadows began to lengthen at
impossible angles, detaching from the objects that should have anchored them.
He would pause on the pavement and see his own shadow stretching far ahead of
him, thicker than the light warranted, as though it possessed an intention
separate from his body. When he turned abruptly there was nothing tangible
behind him, only the pastel façade of houses and the distant sound of forced
merriment.

As days blurred into one another without proper night, Arthur’s grip on reality
frayed. His thoughts fragmented, beginning confidently and dissolving midway
through articulation. He found himself narrating his actions under his breath to
confirm their solidity, whispering that he was walking, turning, breathing, as
though language might pin the world in place. In shop windows he caught glimpses
of figures standing just behind his reflection, tall and indistinct, their
outlines wavering like smoke held in human shape. Each time he spun around there
was only empty pavement and a neighbour offering a too bright grin. The smiles
of the townsfolk now seemed grotesque, their teeth unnaturally uniform, their
laughter fractionally delayed as if synchronised by unseen instruction. He began
to suspect that either they saw the shadows and refused to acknowledge them, or
that they themselves were hollowed out and animated by the same creeping
darkness.

The psychosis tightened around him gradually, then all at once. Sounds became
layered, as though every conversation carried a second whispering track beneath
it. He felt observed not merely from the periphery but from within, as if
something thin and patient had taken up residence behind his eyes. The blue of
his suit flickered in his perception, sometimes luminous, sometimes drained to a
corpse like grey, and he could no longer determine which version was true. His
heart pounded with such ferocity that he feared it might rupture, yet he
remained exhausted beyond measure, a body denied both rest and stability. In
moments of clarity he longed with aching sincerity for his former life. The dim
shop with its humming lights and threadbare carpet now seemed almost merciful.
Depression had been heavy and suffocating, but it had been coherent. It had not
stalked him down pavements or detached itself from hedges to follow at a
measured distance.

On the third sleepless night he stumbled back to the spot where he had first
arrived, drawn by a fading hope that the tear in the air might reappear. The
estate still pulsed behind him in artificial vitality, residents moving
tirelessly beneath a sky that never seemed to dull fully. He stood on the
unremarkable stretch of pavement, swaying slightly, his skull throbbing and his
thoughts skittering like insects across a hot surface. He whispered for the
portal to return, promising silently that he would accept monotony, accept
mediocrity, accept the grey weight of his old existence if only he might escape
this chemically sustained delirium. For several long moments nothing happened,
and the possibility that he was trapped here indefinitely pressed upon him with
suffocating force.

Then he noticed the ground before him darken. His shadow extended unnaturally
far, thickening as it stretched across the pavement. The air ahead began to
ripple, not gently as before but with a raw, tearing motion, as though the
world itself were reluctantly parting. Arthur turned slowly and saw it
forming, the familiar circular wound in reality widening until he could glimpse
beige walls, brown carpet and the dull fluorescence of his old workplace beyond.
The sight undid him. His knees buckled and he fell to the pavement, sobbing with
a depth that felt painfully authentic. In that moment, before he rose to step
through, he understood that even sorrow, when unmanufactured, carried a strange
and necessary mercy.

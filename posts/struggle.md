## Struggle

Rain seeps through the soles of my shoes
Pavements shine with a tired kind of bruise
Shop lights flicker like they might give in
Same as the battle under my skin

Everyone walks like they know where they’re bound
I drift like a ghost with my eyes on the ground
Posters keep shouting that things will improve
But hope feels like something I can’t really prove

Angels in the sky, watched them fly right by
It's a waste of time, when I know I'm going to die

So I queue for the bus, hands numb with the cold
Counting small change like a man growing old
Breath in the air, thin proof I exist
A life that the world nearly managed to miss

Yet something keeps tugging, quiet but strong
A thread saying stay, you’ve lasted this long
Not faith, not courage, not reason why -
Just the stubborn refusal to lie down and die

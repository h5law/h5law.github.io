## Purpose

Purpose is an elusive thing. Some wake up full of vigor ready for the day ahead
with clear goals and intentions, with purpose. Others, however, wake up and lie
in bed all day, unmotivated and wish for their own deaths. I believe this to be
a problem with many things but one of them being purpose.

Purpose may not be what it is that drives people to get on with their lives,
or a lack thereof, take them. What is really at fault is an inability to see
the person in respect's future. If you cannot see yourself having a future,
whether it be the one you dreamed of, the one you envisiged or one at all. Then
you are at the mercy of "purpose".

Purpose, then, is not a starting point but a consequence. We often treat it as
something one must *discover*, as if it were buried beneath the surface of the
self, waiting to be unearthed. But perhaps purpose is not found at all-perhaps
it is *projected*. It emerges only when a person can imagine themselves
continuing, becoming, changing. When that imagined future collapses, purpose
does not vanish because it was never there to begin with; it simply never had
the chance to form.

This places us closer to the existentialists than we might be comfortable
admitting. If the future self is blurred or absent, the present self begins to
feel unreal, weightless. Days lose their narrative thread. Without a story that
extends forward, actions feel arbitrary, and effort seems unjustifiable. It is
not that life lacks meaning, but that meaning requires time to unfold-and time
requires belief in tomorrow.

Ironically, this suggests that purpose is not what saves us from despair;
rather, it is hope, however fragile or undefined. Not hope in a specific
outcome or dream, but hope in continuation itself. To believe that there will be
a “later” version of oneself-one capable of understanding, forgiving, or
reinterpreting the present-is to loosen the grip of purpose over one’s worth. In
this sense, purpose becomes less of a demand and more of a byproduct of
endurance.

Perhaps the task, then, is not to ask *“What is my purpose?”* but *“Can I
imagine myself still here?”* If the answer is even faintly yes, purpose may
follow on its own, quietly and without ceremony. And if it does not, that may be
acceptable too. After all, to exist without a clear purpose is not a failure of
life-it may simply be life before it has finished explaining itself.

## On Purpose [DRAFT]

Purpose is an elusive thing. Some wake up full of vigor ready for the day ahead
with clear goals and intentions, with purpose. Others, however, wake up and lie
in bed all day, unmotivated and wish for their own deaths. I believe this to be
a problem with many things but one of them being purpose.

Purpose may not be what it is that drives people to get on with their lives,
or a lack thereof, take them. What is really at fault is an inability to see
the person in respect's future. If you cannot see yourself having a future,
whether it be the one you dreamed of, the one you envisiged or one at all. Then
you are at the mercy of "purpose".

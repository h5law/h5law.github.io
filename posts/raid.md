## Raid

In the borderlands of Alder Vale, where low stone cottages clung to the earth
and lantern light surrendered early to the press of forest, halfling villages
kept to themselves. Their fields were neat, their doors round, their lives
measured in harvests and hearthfire. Beyond the tilled earth rose the Blackroot
Wood, old as memory and seldom kind. Traders spoke in lowered voices of orc
warbands moving through its depths, iron-shod and ash-marked, raiding where the
king’s banners did not reach. In these small settlements, folk trusted in quiet
routines and the comfort of full cellars, hoping the wider cruelties of the
realm would pass them by.

The raid came with smoke before it came with sound. By the time he opened the
door, the sky was already bruised with ash. The orcs moved through the village
like a verdict, blunt and unquestioning. By nightfall, it was over.

He found them where he had left them that morning. His wife near the hearth.
His children close together, as if they had believed proximity might bargain
with steel. The room was quiet in a way that felt deliberate. He stood in the
doorway, hat in hand, as though arriving late to supper.

He cried then. Not loudly. Not for long. The sound seemed too large for his
small frame, as though grief required a taller body. It passed through him
quickly, like wind through thin branches. In its place something colder settled.
Hatred, yes, but not the blazing sort sung about in ballads. This was a narrow,
precise hatred. Clean. It left no room for anything else.

He was a halfling. His hands were made for picking locks, detecting traps and
the careful tying of fishing line. He imagined himself charging into the dark
after the orcs, blade raised. The image collapsed at once under its own
absurdity. He would not reach their knees before he was cut down. The hatred did
not diminish at this thought. It merely turned inward, searching for a
direction.

He sat at the table beside the bodies and considered his options as one might
consider routes to market. Vengeance was impractical. Flight was meaningless.
Survival felt like an insult. The night pressed against the windows, patient
and unhelpful.

At length he rose, stepped over the broken threshold, and walked to the tavern
at the edge of the lane. It still stood. A few villagers huddled within,
speaking in the hushed tones of those who have seen too much. He ordered a pint
of ale. His voice did not tremble.

He drank it slowly. The ale tasted as it always had. Bitter. Honest. Entirely
indifferent to catastrophe. He found this reassuring. When the cup was empty, he
wiped the foam from his mouth and thanked the innkeeper.

He returned home under a sky that had resumed its ordinary arrangement of stars.
Inside, nothing had changed. The hatred remained, but it had nowhere to go. It
filled him completely, leaving no space for fear, or doubt, or even sorrow.

He fetched a length of rope from the shed. He worked with care, testing the beam
above the hearth as he might once have tested a ladder before harvest. He
positioned himself above his wife and children, as though keeping watch.

For a moment he looked down at them. He tried to summon their names in his
chest, but the hatred had sealed that chamber shut. There was only a vast and
featureless quiet.

Then, in the same night that had taken everything from him, he took everything
left his, himself.

## Numb

He wakes beneath a ceiling

that feels miles above his chest,

gravity choosing him

for its private experiment.



Once, he was lightning -

ideas ringing like bells,

heart outrunning his body,

building empires before sunrise.



Now he is ash.


The clock ticks like a hammer.

The bed keeps his shape.

Morning presses at the curtains

but cannot reach him.


He is tired of the altitude of mania,

tired of the plunge that follows -

the sky opening beneath him

instead of above.


He studies his reflection

like a stranger left behind.


“Self medicating; I just want to be numb”


The words fall heavy,

a plea folded into steel.

He doesn't want joy.

He doesn't want fire.

He just wants quiet -

a stillness without teeth.


Somewhere, deep beneath

the wreckage of extremes,

a small pulse insists:


stay.


Not loudly.

Not brightly.

Just -

stay.

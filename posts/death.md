## Views on Death [TITLT WIP]

In this essay I would like to explore the different death rituals and beliefs of many of the world's
religions and philosophies (if they can be called that). See how they differ and are the same and
explore the traditions of the subjects covered

## Taoism

The famous Taoist contemporary of Lau Tzu, Chuang Tzu famously was beating a tub and singing upon
his wife's death. He said he "thought back to her birth and to the very roots of her being before she
was born... She is now at peace, lying in her chamber". It is clear from this extract that the Taoist
view of death is a physical and permenant one. However not all philosophies and religions see things
the same way.

## Devotion

Although the brain governs our most basic needs such as hunger, sleep and
rational thought, it is the heart - at least in the metaphorical sense - that
appears to rule our sensual and emotional desires. Human beings have long
imagined the heart as the seat of love, longing and vulnerability. Consider a
man hopelessly in love with someone who does not return his feelings. Under his
breath he murmurs, “You are in my cold and hopeless heart tonight.” In this
moment we see how deeply unshared affection can wound, shaping a person’s inner
world regardless of whether the beloved even knows. Matters of the heart do not
require reciprocity to be powerful.

Romantic feeling is often dismissed as impractical or naïve, especially in a
society that prizes logic and productivity. Those who follow emotion over
calculation may be judged as reckless or immature. Yet such dismissal overlooks
the profound insight that romanticism offers into the human condition. To feel
intensely is not a weakness but a sign of engagement with life. Without people
who dare to value emotion, art, poetry and even compassion itself would be
greatly diminished.

Acts inspired by love frequently appear foolish from the outside. To abandon
one’s plans at a moment’s notice for another person, to laugh freely while
soaked by rain, or to attempt the seemingly impossible without preparation -
these behaviours defy conventional reason. However, they also reveal a
willingness to prioritise connection and experience over safety. The romantic
individual accepts uncertainty in exchange for the chance of joy. What appears
irrational may instead be courageous.

Furthermore, such spontaneity allows romantic people to savour the present in a
way that more cautious individuals often cannot. Where others see inconvenience,
they see adventure; where others anticipate embarrassment, they anticipate
memory. Each impulsive act carries with it a spark of hope - the belief that life
is richer when felt deeply rather than merely managed. Their foolishness, then,
is not emptiness but abundance, an overflow of feeling that refuses to be
contained by caution.

Ultimately, the heart’s influence reminds us that human life is not sustained by
logic alone. Reason may guide survival, but love gives survival meaning. Even
unfulfilled affection, even seemingly absurd gestures, testify to a capacity for
wonder and devotion that elevates existence beyond mere routine. Rather than
mocking those who live by their hearts, we might recognise in them a lesson:
that to risk pain is also to make joy possible, and that the most memorable
moments of life are rarely the most sensible ones.

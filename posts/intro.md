# Who even am I?
## From Prison to Programming: A Journey from Chaos to Code

I have been many people, assumed many faces. Some good, others not so, but none
felt entirely me. I am still relatively young and have lived a completely
untraditional life. I've battled addictions, wrestled with my mental health and
served prison time. Yet in all this chaos I experienced a multitude of
rock-bottoms and pinnacles so high.

From sleeping on the streets, to riding jet skis along the coasts of Dubai.
Giving all I had away, and having more than I could ever need. Its been a wild
ride. I often say that it feels as if I have lived through enough to account for
several lifetimes.

But with the chaos and calamity firmly in the past I feel as if I am genuinely
living an entirely new life. The differences are too much to count but each is
a blessing in its own right and I am thankful to even be here now, let alone
finally free from a life wrought with pain ultimately. However, as free from my
past as I may feel I am always conscious of the time I spent in prison, where I
matured from a boy to a man mentally and became the man I am now, through
will and determination.

In prison I learnt that I love to learn. Or more accurately, I rediscovered my
love of learning. Whatever the subject I can dig my teeth in. First it was
Theology and Religious texts, then expanding into Philosophy, then Maths.
Surprisingly without a computer I dived into the realm of computer science. With
no means by which to practice or explore these new concepts I was exploring in
depth; I found a love for Computing behind a cell door. I had my brother printing out Wikipedia pages of words I had never heard and sending them into me, only for
me to ask for even more after reading them. I learned the inner-workings of
Bitcoin, UTXOs, the EVM and Solidity from books and couldn't wait to get behind
a computer.

After being released, a new man with drive and determination, spirit in
abundance. I got to learning more and more. Reading the classics in the world of
Philosophy, 20th century classical literature and of course finally putting
finger to keyboard and immersing myself in code. Algorithms, Data Structures,
Design Patterns, Cryptography, Distributed and Low-level systems I couldn't get
enough. I am still as keen and eager to expand what is possible for me, both
mentally challenging myself and physically in what I take part in as well.

So, now I am here writing the whistle-stop-tour of an introduction to who I am.
I opened by saying something I say a lot: 'I have been many people' but to
expand upon this slogan. I have never been more thankful to be who I am now.
To keep this introduction from being too long I will end with a set of subjects
I intend to write about here for my own sake:

- C, Assembly, Operating Systems and Low-level Programming
- Philosophy, Theology and the articulation of my System of Thought
- Stories from the many lifetimes I have experienced for better or worse
- Personal Blogs covering the Projects I am working on
- Maybe a book or two we'll see

I am sure I will be writing on some of these subjects soon.

Till next time,


Harry (h5law)

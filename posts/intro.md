# Who even am I?

I have struggled with this question a lot. I have been many people, assumed
many faces. Some good, others bad but none really me. I am not too old, -
yet not very young either. I have lived an untraditional life. Sold drugs,
battled addictions, wrestled with my mental health, served prison time,
found god, disconnected from the real world and given all I had away yet here
I am. Writing an introductory post to my blog or thought dump website.

In prison I learnt I love to learn, and through all the troubles I still do
and continue to learn something new everyday. Its so cliche but its true. I
feel the moment I stop reaching into the unknown, the moment I stop trying to
solve problems; that's when I will have died, a spiritual death. I, as I am
now, would no longer exist.

I won't make this post too long so here are some of my interests:
- C
- Go
- Programming
- Operating Systems
- Systems Programming
- Writing Old School Runescape Bots
- Philosophy
- Reading
- And more.

I am sure I will be writing on some of these subjects soon.

Till next time,

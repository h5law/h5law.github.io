# Who even am I?
## From Prison to Programming: A Journey from Chaos to Code

Throughout my life, I've been many different people, each with their own mask.
Some were good, others not so good, but none felt entirely "me". Despite my apparent
youth, I have already lived many completely untraditional lives. I've battled
addictions, wrestled with my mental health, and even served prison time. In all
this chaos, I have experienced both rock bottom and the top of the mountain. I
used to think the way my life had unfolded up to now was normal and common to
most people but as I started to venture out of the echo chamber of poor
decisions and regrettable actions I had found myself in I realised my life was
anything but normal.

Most teenagers don't sleep rough in a car park alienated from their families.
Or get sectioned and taken to mental hospitals across the country. They don't get
drawn into the drug game due to a feeling of necessity. But what the average
teenager does felt foreign to me. Part of me feels as though I missed out. I
didn't get to have the exploration that comes with a safe space to mature in. I
had to mature fast and in full to survive. Yet, despite that I am grateful for
the experiences (no matter how bad they may have been) as they shaped the way I
look at the world and how I figure my place in it.

From rough sleeping to jet skiing along the coasts of Dubai. From giving away
all I had, to having more than I could ever need. It's been a wild ride, for
sure. I've often said that I've packed enough into my one life to fill several
lifetimes. And it's in those several lifetimes that I have accumulated a
somewhat unique perspective on life, or at least an interesting tint on the
glasses through which I view the world around me.

It took a while, and a lot of hard work to pull myself out of the depths of the
pit I had dug myself into but every step I took away from my old life and towards
something new, something better, was a step I was determined to take. Truthfully
it was my time in prison where I grew from a boy into a man, and matured mentally.
I had been forced to mature quickly out of necessity but I had in all honesty not
done so in the true sense of the word.

In prison, I discovered that I love to learn. Or more accurately, I rediscovered my
passion for learning. Whatever the subject is, I can dig my teeth into it. First, it
was Theology and Religious texts, then expanding into Philosophy, then Maths.
Surprisingly without a computer, I dived into the realm of computer science. With
no means by which to practice or explore these new concepts, that I was exploring
in-depth, I found a love for Computing behind a cell door. I had my brother
printing out Wikipedia pages of words and concepts I had never heard of. He would
send them to me, only for me to ask for even more after reading them and
finding something new I did not know of. I learned the inner workings of
Bitcoin, UTXOs, the EVM, and Solidity from books and couldn't wait to get behind
a computer. I was fascinated but the way money worked and the potential that
decentralised finance could bring to the seemingly fragile and deceptive system
I was learning about through a great number of books available to me at the time.

So with the chaos and calamity firmly in the past, I feel as if I am genuinely
living an entirely new life. The differences are too much to count but each is
a blessing in its own right and I am thankful to even be here now, let alone
finally free from a life wrought with pain at every junction. However,
as free from my past as I may feel I am always conscious of the time I spent in
prison, where I matured mentally and became the man I am now, through will and
determination.

After being released, a new man with drive and determination, and spirit in
abundance. I got to learning more and more. Reading the classics from the world
of Philosophy; 20th-century classical literature and of course finally putting
fingers on a keyboard and immersing myself in code. Algorithms, Data Structures,
Design Patterns, Cryptography, Distributed and Low-level systems I couldn't get
enough. I am still as keen and eager to expand what is possible for me, I am
keen to discover the limits of the new lease on life I have been given and then
surpass them all the same. I have learned that a life without learning, with no
curiosity, at least for me, leads to nothing good. But a curious mind and an
eager spirit of determination can take you places you would never have imagined
possible.

So, now I am here writing the whistle-stop-tour of an introduction to who I am.
I opened by saying something I say a lot: 'I have been many different people'
but to expand upon this slogan. I have never been more thankful to be who I am
now. To keep this introduction from being too long I will end with a set of
subjects I intend to write about here for my own sake:

- C, Assembly, Operating Systems, and Low-level Programming
- Philosophy, Theology, and the Articulation of my System of Thought
- Stories from the many lifetimes I have experienced for better or worse
- Personal Blogs covering the Projects I am working on
- Maybe a book or two we'll see

I am sure I will be writing on some of these subjects soon.

Till next time,


Harry (h5law)

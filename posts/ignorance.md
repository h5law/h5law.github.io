## Ignorance

They say *“Ignorance is bliss,”* but would you rather know? The question lingers
whenever uncertainty looms: if an unwelcome truth lay just ahead, would you
choose to uncover it early or allow it to arrive unannounced? To know is to live
in the shadow of anticipation, to rehearse outcomes before they unfold. Yet
ignorance is not quite peace either. It is simply the absence of foresight, a
quiet that can be shattered at any moment. Whether something is predicted or
not, the event itself does not change. Only our mental state beforehand does.

Foreknowledge offers the illusion of control. When we believe we know what is
coming, we imagine we can prepare, soften the blow, or even prevent the worst
from happening. In some cases this is true. A diagnosis caught early, a storm
forecast in time, a warning heeded - these forms of knowledge can save lives.
But preparation also has a cost. Waiting for misfortune can be its own kind of
suffering, stretching a single moment of pain into days, months, or years of
dread.

Ignorance, on the other hand, compresses suffering into the instant it occurs.
The shock may be sharper, the disorientation more severe, but it is brief.
There is no long prelude of worry, no sleepless nights spent imagining every
possible outcome. For some, this immediacy feels more humane. Life proceeds
unburdened until it cannot. The ignorant person may walk into difficulty
unprepared, but also unafraid.

Still, ignorance should not be confused with incapacity. Not knowing beforehand
does not mean one cannot respond wisely in the moment. Human beings are
remarkably adaptive. Faced with crisis, people often discover reserves of
courage, ingenuity, and calm they did not know they possessed. Instinct,
experience, and emotion can guide action just as effectively as careful
planning. In this sense, ignorance does not strip a person of agency; it
merely alters the timing of their response.

There is also a moral dimension to ignorance. Sometimes not knowing is a choice,
a turning away from uncomfortable truths. This kind of ignorance can be harmful,
allowing injustice, suffering, or personal failings to persist unchallenged.
Bliss becomes complicity. Yet there are also limits to what any person can bear
to know at once. Selective attention is part of survival. No one can carry the
full weight of every possible sorrow.

Ultimately, the value of ignorance or knowledge depends less on the information
itself and more on how we live with it. What shapes us is not whether we saw the
storm coming, but how we weather it once it arrives. Some people prepare
meticulously and still falter. Others stumble blindly into hardship and stand
firm. Ignorance may soften the path beforehand, knowledge may steady the steps
along it, but neither determines the strength of the traveller. What matters
most is not what we knew, but what we chose to do when knowing - or not knowing -
ceased to matter.

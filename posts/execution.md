## Execution

Five minutes. Five minutes circled his thoughts - five minutes until execution -
five minutes spent praying for a stay, for mercy, for anything. None came. He
wondered, if he truly had five minutes to live, who would he be? A loving
father. A husband to a beautiful wife, reminding her every second of every day
how deeply she was cherished. Children laughing, running through open fields.
Idyllic. Comforting. Impossible.

Those five minutes shrank to two as his head was forced onto the block - the
guillotine looming above him - its shadow cold against his neck. He knew what
followed.

His life had been anything but idyllic. A career criminal. A mercenary for hire.
In the heat of a moment, he had murdered a man in cold blood and felt no
remorse then. “It was either him or me,” he had said without hesitation. Yet the
dream of those imagined five minutes betrayed what he had wanted instead. Not
bloodshed. Not coin. A quiet life - a dairy farmer, a sheep herder - hands rough
from honest work, lungs full of clean air. Nature had been his only comfort,
stolen in brief moments whenever he could escape the world he had made.

With his head pressed to the wood, two minutes remained. At first his mind went
blank. Then the memories surged back - what he had done, what he had become,
what he could never be. His face tightened, muscles drawn and trembling. His jaw
clenched, then quivered. His brow furrowed deep with regret he had never allowed
himself to feel. Guilt carved itself into his expression, followed by shame, raw
and unavoidable. Tears slipped from the corners of his eyes, tracing slow paths
down dirt-streaked cheeks as the truth settled in - this was the end.

Only then did he truly hear the crowd. Cheers. Laughter. Voices hungry for
finality, for spectacle. A witch hunt disguised as justice. How could anyone
celebrate this, he wondered. The end of a man’s life was not something to
applaud. It was something to mourn - as his priest had reminded him again and
again - because in death, all men are the same.

The crowd heard a sharp **clink** as the blade was released, followed by a
hollow **thud** as his head fell into the basket below.

It was done.

## Happiness

I used to think happiness was something you reached. A moment where things
finally made sense, where effort softened into ease. But the longer I sit with
the question-*what is happiness?*-the less convincing that idea becomes.
Happiness, if it exists at all, does not seem to wait at the end of the road.
It walks beside us, often disguised as struggle.

The happiness we think of is often elusive; we can grasp it for a, or moments,
but it is gone just as quick as we got ahold of it. We are in an eternal
struggle to catch the next fix of happiness allotted to us. This struggle for
happiness is in our human nature, we crave it - long for it. But is it anything
more than an intense battle with struggle. A struggle with no permanent end.

In the meantime, of searching for happiness we suffer, we struggle, we are in
pain - the opposite of happiness, but without these feelings, there could be no
such thing as happiness. If we had never felt sad, pain, sorrow, we couldn't
even comprehend what happiness is in the slightest. But because we do there is
a chance for us. A chance for happiness.

But perhaps this happiness that we all chase is really a culmination of the pain
that brought us there. A respite of sorts, the pain, sorrow, etc. doesn't just
disappear but instead is masked by something more tolerable, something we put up
with even in the face of our immense weight we carry.

Happiness itself is absurd in essence, it's just an emotion but one with so much
meaning. Why do we suffer for its sake, why go through pain for it too?

Life offers no clear instructions. There is no visible blueprint explaining why
we suffer, fail, or lose what we love. We want meaning, but the world does not
answer in language we can understand. And yet, despite this silence, we
continue. We wake up, we try again, we carry our weight uphill even when it
rolls back down.

What strikes me is that happiness doesn’t disappear in this confrontation—it
changes shape.

There is a kind of happiness that comes from resistance. Not the loud,
celebratory kind, but the quiet satisfaction of standing upright in a world
that does not bend for us. To keep going without illusions, without guarantees,
requires a certain inner strength. And in that strength, there is something
deeply alive.

Pain, too, plays an uncomfortable role. We are taught to avoid it, to see it as
proof that something has gone wrong. But pain often marks the moments when we
are most engaged with life—when we are growing, risking, choosing. A life
without friction might be comfortable, but it would also be shallow. Happiness
cannot be reduced to comfort without losing something essential.

I’ve come to think that happiness is less about what happens to us and more
about how we respond. Do we shrink from difficulty, or do we let it shape us? Do
we resent the weight we carry, or do we claim it as ours? There is a subtle joy
in realising that even when circumstances are unfair or absurd, our response
still belongs to us.

This doesn’t mean forcing optimism onto a broken situation. It means clarity.
Seeing the world as it is, stripped of false promises, and choosing to live
anyway. There is dignity in that choice. Even beauty.

Perhaps happiness is not the feeling that life is easy, but the realisation that
life is *worth engaging with* - even when it hurts, even when it makes no sense.
It is found in effort, in persistence, in saying “yes” to existence without
demanding that it justify itself first.

So when I ask myself what happiness is, I no longer imagine a final state of
peace. I imagine movement. Struggle. Awareness. The steady act of living
honestly.

And maybe that is enough.

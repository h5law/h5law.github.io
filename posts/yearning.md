## Yearning

The burn in the chest. The ache in the heart. The quiet, persistent pull toward
the one of your dreams. Nothing rivals longing - it is a subtle torture that
eats away slowly, patiently, as if time itself were sharpening the blade. It
does not wound all at once. It lingers. It hums beneath every thought. It turns
ordinary moments into reminders of what is absent.

Yearning is not loud. It is not dramatic. It is a soft, steady erosion of
certainty. A whisper that says something is missing. A hunger that no meal
satisfies. You carry it into crowded rooms and into lonely nights. You feel it
in laughter that fades too quickly, in music that sounds nothing but noise, in
the space beside you that remains untouched.

For a fortunate few, longing becomes a bridge - a path that leads to wholeness
and fulfilment. The dream materialises. The hand reaches back. The ache quiets.
In those rare moments, yearning proves itself worthwhile, almost sacred, as if
the suffering was merely preparation for what is to come.

But for most, yearning is a horizon that never draws nearer. A pursuit without
capture. We learn to survive it. We build lives around it - families, careers,
friendships, rituals. We cultivate meaning in a hundred different ways. These
things sustain us. They give shape to our days. They teach us gratitude.

And yet, somewhere beneath the gratitude, the ember remains.

Perhaps the cruelty of yearning is not that it goes unanswered, but that it
reveals our capacity to love beyond reason. It shows us the depth of what we
are willing to feel, the magnitude of what we dare to hope for. It exposes the
vastness within us - the space where desire lives.

Longing may never be satisfied. It may never fully loosen its grip. But it
reminds us that we are alive - that our hearts are capable of reaching beyond
what is present, beyond what is certain, toward something luminous and just out
of reach.

And sometimes, that reaching is its own kind of meaning.

## Introduction

Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm [h5law](https://github.com/h5law), a protocol developer at
[Pocket Network](https://pokt.network) working on building out the new version
of the protocol - referred to as "Shannon". We are building a permissionless,
decentralised RPC network that incentivises API services in general. The main
focus at the moment is for Web3 projects, Blockchains and dApp developers but
the longer term vision is for Pocket to be the base layer for RPC access to any
and all API services (LLMs, and whatever else you can run we could service your
requests).

This article is about my journey over the last year, after submitting my
[first PR](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/pull/397) a lot has changed.
I've learned so much; grown as a developer; made/contributed to some **really
cool** stuff, in my opinion at least; and been challenged in so many ways. I
hope to capture some of these in this article
